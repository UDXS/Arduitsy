---
### A tiny Arduino daughterboard that can fit in every project and is meant to power your smaller projects (Can be programmed by Arduino)
---
#### Specs
* Reset Button
* Atmel ATtiny85 (It's Arduino Compatible!)
* 5 programmable pins
* 2 PWM pins
* 3 Analog Read pins
* All can be used as digital
* ICSP(In-Circuit Serial Programming) lets you program it with any ICSP programmer or even any Arduino using ArduinoISP (Requires jumper wires)! [Link](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)
* JST-PH connector which means you can connect any LiPo or Battery Pack to it

#### Ingredients Required
* 2x 10k ohm 0805 surface-mount resistors
* 1x .1uF 0805 surface-mount capacitor
* 1x ATtiny85 8-SOIC
* 1x 2x03 male header
* 1x Surface Mount Reset Button
* 1x 0805 LED (Orange recommended)
* 2x 1X04 stacking (male & female) headers (recommended)

OR (instead of stacking headers)
* 2x 1X04 male headers

OR
* 2x 1X04 female headers

Note: You may have to purchase larger headers then break them up
